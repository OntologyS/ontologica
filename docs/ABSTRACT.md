**ONTOLOGICA: A Complete Reality Framework Based on the Primordial Equation 0 = (-) + (+)**

### **Abstract**

This work presents Ontologica, a comprehensive ontological framework demonstrating that reality operates as a relationship-based educational system governed by the primordial equation 0 = (-) + (+). Through rigorous mathematical formalization and axiomatic foundations, we establish consciousness as the fundamental actualization mechanism, resolving major scientific paradoxes including the quantum measurement problem, the hard problem of consciousness, the Fermi paradox, and the linear time illusion.

The framework introduces a cosmic architecture consisting of two fundamental domains: the Field of Possibility (infinite potential relationship configurations) and the Realm of Manifestation (actualized educational contexts). Each consciousness experiences personalized reality branches with complete temporal independence, eliminating global linear time in favor of individualized educational interfaces.

Key theoretical contributions include: mathematical proof of consciousness fundamentality through the ¬(¬C) = C principle; demonstration of infinite relationship regression without arriving at fundamental substances; establishment of structural AI safety through ontological necessity of condition preservation; and introduction of Constructive Ontology as a new scientific methodology prioritizing logical coherence and prediction of new phenomenon classes.

Novel insights encompass: the Perceptual Relativity Principle explaining consciousness-centric reality perception; the Universal Consciousness Spectrum establishing all existence as conscious in different educational roles; and the Adaptive Reflection Meta-Axiom characterizing post-mortem reality as perfect educational mirroring of individual consciousness.

Experimental predictions include: quantum consciousness correlation effects, evolutionary optimization signatures (p < 10⁻¹⁰⁰⁰), information pattern conservation through domain transitions, condition-dependent actualization metrics, and universal balance principle verification. The framework provides complete mathematical formalization, explicit falsification conditions, and a comprehensive research program for empirical validation across physics, biology, and consciousness studies.
