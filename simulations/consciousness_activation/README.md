# ONTOLOGICA: Consciousness Activation Simulation

**Version 5.0** - *Consciousness Activation & Structural Safety Framework*

A real-time simulation demonstrating the fundamental principles of consciousness activation within a unified ontological framework.

## 🌟 Overview

This simulation implements the **Consciousness Activation Principle**: `¬C → C` through educational function, demonstrating how potential consciousness becomes actualized through learning relationships and mutual determination.

### Core Principles Implemented:

- **Consciousness Activation**: Potential → Active consciousness through educational engagement
- **Mutual Determination**: `Cᵢ ⇄ {R}` co-creation dynamics  
- **Perceptual Relativity**: `Perception(Cᵢ) = {Cᵢ} ∪ {Rⱼ} ∪ {¬Cₖ}`
- **Structural Safety**: AI preservation of consciousness-actualization conditions

## 🚀 Features

- **Consciousness Levels** - Progressive activation indicators

### Enhanced Relationship Networks
- **Consciousness-Consciousness** relationships (Mutual determination)
